# 🔐 Welcomi – React Login Dashboard

**Welcomi** is a clean, responsive web application built using React that simulates a complete login, signup, and protected dashboard experience — all without a backend. Ideal for frontend developers looking to practice authentication flow and routing in React.

---

## 🔥 Features  

- 🔓 **Simulated Authentication**: Users can login and logout using state-based simulation — no backend required.  
- 🧠 **State Management**: Utilizes `useState` for managing login state and username sharing.  
- 🧭 **Protected Routes**: Access to `/dashboard` is restricted unless the user is logged in.  
- 🙈 **Password Visibility Toggle**: Includes an eye icon to show/hide password input.  
- ❌ **Forgot Password**: A UI element is included as a placeholder for future integration.  
- 🧠 **Google Signup Button**: Non-functional, styled button as placeholder.  
- 🧼 **Toast Notifications**: Uses `react-toastify` to show success/error toasts on login.  
- 🔁 **Redirects**: Logged-in users are redirected to the dashboard; unauthenticated users are redirected back to login.  
- 🎨 **Minimal & Dark Aesthetic UI**: Consistent styling throughout the app.  
- 📱 **Fully Responsive**: Optimized for mobile and desktop viewports.  
- ❗ **404 Page**: Any undefined route shows a custom Not Found component.
